1 => About application


---------------------------------------------------------------
2 => Usage

./httpd [PORT]

[PORT] - port number that is not in use on this system

For developement:
	$ make                (Will compile the server)
	$ make & make install (Will compile the server and install) (*needs evelated priveledges* **root access in most cases**)
	$ make distclean	  (Will clean all compiled .o and application files)
---------------------------------------------------------------
3 => Implement description

httpd.c: 
	
--------------------------
server.c: (server.h)
	runServer():
		Runs the server in infinit loop and waits for connection to socket.
		when a message is received from socket it returns it to decodeMessage().

--------------------------
printing.c: (printing.h)
	printToOutput():
		Prints input message to the stdout, put concats a timestamp to the output.

	printToOutputRequest():
		Prints to stdout the request , filename and ipaddress:port of client connecting, also gets timestamp concated to the output.

	printToOutputError():
		Prints to the stdout all error messages that are sent to client, that is opcode error.

	printBanner():
		Only prints the beutyful banner on start, *So pretty*
--------------------------
debugging.c: (debugging.h)  // note this is only for debugging the applictaion.
	// to be able to use these functions please change the "#define debug" macro inside debugging.h to 1 etc. (#define debug 1)

	printTime():
		Function that only prints out the exact server time to the output (note: SERVER TIME)
